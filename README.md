- If there is 3 sixes continuous in the dice for a individual player, then all the moves of the player is invalid.
- After having a Six in the dice, the player has a choice to select piece and it's moves.
- A picec can't be eaten when it is in the star.
- The player gets a bonus move after eating a opponent's piece.
- A player wins when his all pieces reach to the end box.

## Bugs:
