# Ludo_Flutter
Trying to build ludo in flutter.


# Ludo Game rules:

- Dice goes round the table until there is a Six or Opponent Pieces is eaten.
- If there is 3 sixes continuous in the dice for a individual player, then all the moves of the player is invalid.
- After having a Six in the dice, the player has a choice to select piece and it's moves.
- A picec can't be eaten when it is in the star.
- The player gets a bonus move after eating a opponent's piece.
- A player wins when his all pieces reach to the end box.

## Bugs:

- Sometimes ludo's green sides doesn't glow. 

# Progressing UI
